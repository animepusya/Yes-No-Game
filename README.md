# Danetka. Think Again.

**Danetka** is a logic-based riddle card game inspired by classic *Yes / No* riddles.

Players try to uncover a hidden story by asking questions that can only be answered with  
**Yes**, **No**, or **Doesn’t matter**.

The app focuses on clean UI, smooth animations, and a simple but engaging game flow.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- One player acts as the **host** and chooses a riddle card
- The host reads the description and keeps the full story hidden
- Other players ask questions to reconstruct the situation
- Answers are limited to **Yes**, **No**, or **Doesn’t matter**
- Hints are available if the discussion gets stuck
- The full story is revealed at the end

The game is designed for playing with friends and encourages discussion and logical thinking.
